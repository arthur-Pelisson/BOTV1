There are\n[many node.js packages](https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/riot-games-api/show/iXR9Vl2A) out\nthere which give you access to the Riot API, but none has as complete a feature set as lol.js.\n\n**Note 2.x has breaking changes.**  See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for details.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n* Support for the following APIs:\n  * game-v1.3\n  * lol-static-data-v1.2 (partial)\n  * match-v2.2\n  * matchlist-v2.2\n  * summoner-v1.4\n  * team-v2.4\n  * it's fairly easy to add other APIs - if you need something please raise an issue and I'll\n    add it in for you, or send a Pull Request.\n* Native promise support\n* Built in support for rate limiting.\n* Built in support for flexible caching with the caching engine of your choice.  Built in support\n  is available for Redis and an in-memory cache, however it is easy to write support for other\n  databases if you wish.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n    npm install --save lol-js\n\nExample Usage\n=============\n\nWith callbacks:\n\n```\nvar lol = require('lol-js');\nvar lolClient = lol.client({\n    apiKey: 'blahblahblah',\n    cache: lol.redisCache({host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6379})\n};\nlolClient.getChampionById('na', 53, {champData: ['all']}, function(err, data) {\n    console.log(\"Found \", data.name);\n    lolClient.destroy();\n});\n```\n\nWith promises:\n\n```\nvar lol = require('lol-js');\nvar lolClient = lol.client({\n    apiKey: 'blahblahblah',\n    cache: lol.redisCache({host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6379})\n});\nlolClient.getChampionById('na', 53, {champData: ['all']})\n.then(function (data) {\n    console.log(\"Found \", data.name);\n    lolClient.destroy();\n});\n```\n\nCreating a Client\n=================\n\nThe first step to using lol-js is to create a new client by calling `lol.client()`.  This function\ntakes a configuation object with the following options:\n\n* `apiKey` - the API key [assigned to you by Riot](https://developer.riotgames.com/).\n* `cache` - a cache object or `null` to disable caching (see below).\n* `cacheTTL` - a `{long, short, flex}` object which controls how long objects are cached\n  for.  Each is a value in seconds.  `long` applies to match objects, which don't change very\n  often.  Most objects are cached for the `short` duration.  Default is one month for `long` and\n  5 minutes for `short`.  If `flex` is not null (defaults to one month) then all objects will be\n  stored in the cache for the `flex` TTL, however when an object is retrieved from the cache, we\n  will still try to fetch a new copy of the object from Riot if the object is older than the\n  short/long TTLs.  If the Riot API is unavailable for some reason (the Riot API rather frequently\n  returns 503) then the \"expired\" value will be used from the cache.  Note that if `flex` is null\n  then in such a case lol-js will retry the request a few times instead.\n* `rateLimit` - a list of limit objects.  Each limit object is a `{time, limit}` pair where `time`\n  is a duration in seconds and `limit` is the maximum number of requests to make in that\n  duration.  Defaults to `[{time: 10, limit: 10}, {time: 600, limit: 500}]`.\n\nFunctions\n=========\n\nYou can browse the well-documented code in the [`src/api`](https://github.com/jwalton/lol-js/tree/master/src/api)\nfolder for a complete description of all the functions you can call.  Each file in `src/api` is a\nmixin object which is added to the client object's prototype.  Note that the source files only\ncontain the promise version of the code - the callback versions are generated automatically.\n\nCaching\n=======\n\nlol-js will automatically cache results from Riot's API for you, allowing you to focus on using\nthe data rather than worrying about rate limits and the Riot server going down.\n\nThe easiest way to cache objects is to use a built-in cache type.  The following built in cache\ntypes exist:\n\n* `lol.lruCache(options)` - Caches all objects in memory.  Based on [isaacs](https://github.com/isaacs)'s\n  [lru-cache](https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache), and can take any options that the\n  `LRU` constructor can take.\n* `lol.redisCache({host, port, keyPrefix})` - Caches objects in Redis.  `host` and `port` are\n  the connection details for your redis server and default to `'127.0.0.1'` and `6379`,\n  respectively.  `keyPrefix` is a prefix to prepend to all keys stored in Redis and defaults\n  to `'loljs-'`.  You may want to read about [using Redis as an LRU cache](http://redis.io/topics/lru-cache)\n  if you want to use Redis, or you can risk running out of memory.\n\nIf you don't want to use one of the built in cache types, you can easily specify your own caching\nfunctions.  The `cache` parameter passed to a new client is a `{set, get, destroy}` object, where\n`set(params, value)` stores an object in the cache, and `get(params, callback)`\nis a function which retrieves an object from the cache and calls `callback(err, value)` returning\nthe cached value or `null` if the value is not available.  In both cases, params is an object\nconsisting of:\n\n* `params.key` - A string which uniquely identifies this object.\n* `params.ttl` - The suggested length, in seconds, to cache the object for.  `null` if the object\n  can be cached forever.\n* `params.api` - A `{name, version}` object (e.g. `{name: 'match', version: 'v2.2'}`.)\n* `params.objectType` - The type of object being cached.  This is always a string consisting of\n  only letters.\n* `params.region` - The region used to make the request.\n* `params.params` - A hash of parameters which identify the object - this is different for each\n  object type.  For example, for a \"summonerByName\" `objectType`, this will be a `{summonerName}`\n  object.\n\nWhen calling `cache.set()`, lol-js may pass in `\"none\"` in place of a value to indicate the value\ndoes not exist.  `cache.get()` should return `\"none\"` if such a params object is passed in.\nlol-js will always try to retrieve an object from the cache first, and will only make a REST\nrequest if the cached object is not available.\n\nFinally, if the cache defines a `destroy()` function, this will be called when the lol-js client\nis destroyed.\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nIf you're interested in contributing, check out the [development docs](./docs/development.md).\n",
